Founded in 2011, Uni Light Studio is a production company based in Los Angeles. We are dedicated to creating beauty in commercial and experimental digital media. Our talent and interests range from film to CGI and 3D animation, and especially the synthesis of the two.  

We strive to make exciting, challenging, and practical products that blur the boundaries of art and technology. Our wide breadth of skills allow us to deliver new and engaging forms of media on time and on budget, no matter how large or complicated the project.
